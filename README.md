# Garuda

Garuda is a terminal coding agent. Version 0.1 is in progress.
The requirements doc defines the scope. Code, tests and commits refer to its IDs (F1–F26, N1–N8).

## Status

| Milestone | State |
| --- | --- |
| M1 Skeleton and fake model | Done |
| M2 Read-only tools | Done |
| M3 Write tools and permissions | Done |
| M4 Limits, context, sessions | Next |
| M5 CLI polish and evals | — |

## Use

You need Node 22 or later and pnpm 10. Node 25 and later do not include corepack, so install pnpm with npm:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm@10
pnpm install
pnpm check          # typecheck + lint + tests
pnpm build
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export GARUDA_MODEL=<model-id>
node dist/cli/index.js                                  # prints a greeting
node dist/cli/index.js -p "Explain what this repo does" # runs one task
```

Tools: read_file, glob and grep run with no question.
write_file, edit_file and bash show a diff or the command first. You pick: allow once, allow for this session, or deny.
Commands run on your machine with no sandbox in 0.1, so read each one before you allow it.

Try it on this repo:

```sh
node dist/cli/index.js -p "Where is runAgent defined, and what does it do?"
node dist/cli/index.js -p "Run the tests and tell me the result"
```

## Permissions

Put rules in `.garuda/settings.json` in the project. Deny rules always win.

```json
{
  "executor": "host",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["bash(pnpm test*)", "bash(git status)", "edit_file(src/**)"],
    "deny": ["bash(rm -rf*)", "bash(git push*)"]
  },
  "env": { "allow": ["NODE_ENV"] }
}
```

- A rule is `tool` (every call) or `tool(pattern)`.
- File patterns are globs relative to the root. A name without `/` matches at any depth.
- Command patterns use `*` for any text. Garuda splits a command at `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|` and `$(…)`.
  A deny rule blocks the command when one part matches. An allow rule must match every part.
- Sensitive files (`.env*`, keys, `.npmrc`, `.aws/`, …) are blocked, also for reads.
  An allow rule that names the file, for example `read_file(.env.example)`, unblocks it.
- Write tools never change files in `.git/`.
- Commands see only these environment variables: `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `TERM`,
  `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TMPDIR`, `TZ`, plus the names in `env.allow`. API keys stay out.
- With no terminal on stdin (a pipe or CI), Garuda cannot ask, so it denies calls that need approval.

## Standalone binary

`pnpm package` builds one executable file, `bin/garuda`, for the machine you build on.
It holds Node and all of Garuda, so the target machine does not need Node.
It needs Node 25.5 or later to build (it uses `node --build-sea`).

```sh
pnpm package
./bin/garuda                 # greeting
./bin/garuda --version
sudo cp bin/garuda /usr/local/bin/   # optional: put it on your PATH
```

Notes:

- The binary is about 100–150 MB, because it contains the Node runtime.
- Build on each platform that you want to run on. A binary built on an Apple silicon Mac runs only on Apple silicon Macs.
- On macOS, the script signs the binary ad hoc (`codesign --sign -`), so it runs on the machine that built it.
- Homebrew's Node has single executables turned off. The script then downloads the official Node build of
  the same version from nodejs.org, checks its SHA-256 sum and keeps it in `~/.cache/garuda`.
  Set `GARUDA_SEA_NODE=/path/to/node` to use a Node binary of your choice, or `NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR` to use a mirror.

## Layout

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/model/` | Provider-neutral types, `ModelClient`, the Anthropic adapter, the fake model |
| `src/loop/` | `runAgent(session, deps)`: the agent loop |
| `src/tools/` | `Tool<I, O>`, the registry, and the tools: `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `bash` |
| `src/permissions/` | Path guard (F15), rules, sensitive paths, settings, and the permission engine (F17–F20) |
| `src/sandbox/` | `Executor` interface, `ExecPolicy`, `HostExecutor`. The only place that starts processes (N8) |
| `src/session/` | In-memory session state and read tracking for edit_file |
| `src/cli/` | Entry point: greeting, one-shot mode with `-p`, the terminal approver |
| `scripts/` | Build helpers. `package.mjs` makes the standalone binary |
| `test/` | Vitest suites. `loop.test.ts`, `m2.acceptance.test.ts` and `m3.acceptance.test.ts` hold the milestone acceptance tests. `executorContract.ts` is the suite every executor must pass |

## Rules

- The loop gets all dependencies as arguments. It never imports the CLI.
- Only `src/model/anthropic.ts` imports the Anthropic SDK (N1).
- Only `src/sandbox/` may start processes (N8). Biome and a test enforce this.
- Strict TypeScript. No `any` in public interfaces (N7).
